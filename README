In order to build you must have at the very least the Microsoft Visual C++
compiler and the latest Windows SDK installed. Modification of the makefile
may be necessary if the installation locations are different than stated
in the makefile.

LICENSE: The code may be used freely, but I ask that credit is given where
due if code is reused.

DISCLAIMER: Building with any other compiler besides the Microsoft compiler
is not supported and is done at your own risk. I am not responsible for
corruption or issues that result from tampering with the code or the build
process.
